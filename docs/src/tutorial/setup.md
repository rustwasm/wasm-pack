# Tools Setup

## Rust

If you haven't already, you'll need to install nightly Rust with the wasm toolchain!
See [the setup section](setup.html) for more details. Once you've done that you'll need to install
the latest version of `wasm-pack`.

```bash
$ cargo install wasm-pack
```

## npm

If you also have not installed npm already you'll need to do so! Follow the docs available on
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

To confirm you've succeeded run:

```bash
$ npm --version
```

You should see the version number pop out in your terminal if you installed it successfully!

## npm account

After you have npm installed you'll need to sign up for an account on npm if you have not already
done so in order to complete the tutorial and so you can publish your package. The sign up page can
be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/signup).
