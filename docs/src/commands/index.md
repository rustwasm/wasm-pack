# Commands

`wasm-pack` has several commands to help you during the process of building
a Rust-generated WebAssembly project.

- `new`: This command generates a new project for you using a template. [Learn more][generate]
- `build`: This command builds a `pkg` directory for you with compiled wasm and generated JS. [Learn more][build]
- `pack` and `publish`: These command will create a tarball, and optionally publish it to a registry, such as npm. [Learn more][pack-pub]


### Deprecated Commands
- `init`: This command has been deprecated in favor of `build`.

[build]: ./build.html
[new]: ./new.html
[pack-pub]: ./pack-and-publish.html
