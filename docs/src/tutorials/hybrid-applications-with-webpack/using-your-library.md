# Run The Code

The Rust Webpack template is designed for creating monorepo-style Web applications with
Rust-generated WebAssembly and Webpack without publishing your wasm to NPM.
This portion of the tutorial will explain how to build a [Webpack] JavaScript project
that will run your WebAssembly code in the browser.

[Webpack]: https://webpack.js.org/

## Scaffold a JavaScript Project

To generate a new Rust Webpack project, we've used the [`rust-webpack`] npm template.

[`rust-webpack`]: https://github.com/rustwasm/rust-webpack-template

```
npm init rust-webpack your-package-name
```

A new project folder will be created with the name you supply.

If we look in the project, we'll see the following:

- `.gitignore`: ignores `node_modules`
- `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT`: most Rust projects are licensed this way, so these are included for you
- `README.md`: the file you are reading now!
- `index.html`: a bare bones html document that includes the webpack bundle
- `js/index.js`: example JS file with a comment showing how to import and use a wasm pkg
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`:
  - pulls in devDependencies for using webpack:
      - [`webpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack)
      - [`webpack-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli)
      - [`webpack-dev-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server)
  - defines a `start` script to run `webpack-dev-server`
- `webpack.config.js`: configuration file for bundling your JS with webpack
- `crate/src/lib.rs`: your Rust crate code!

## Your Rust Crate

The scaffolded project includes an example Rust WebAssembly webpack crate.

Inside the `crate/src/lib.rs` file we see a `run` function that's callable from our JS file:
```rust
// Called by our JS entry point to run the example.
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn run() -> Result<(), JsValue> {
    set_panic_hook();

    // ...
    let p: web_sys::Node = document.create_element("p")?.into();
    p.set_text_content(Some("Hello from Rust, WebAssembly, and Webpack!"));
    // ...

    Ok(())
}
```

Now, open up the `js/index.js` file. We see our Rust-generated wasm `main_js` function being
called inside our JS file.

```js
import("../pkg/index.js")
  .then((module) => {
    module.main_js();
  })
  .catch(console.error);
```

## Run The Project

To generate our Rust-compiled to wasm code, in the root directory we run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create our bundled JavaScript module in a new directory `dist`.

We should be ready to run our project now!
In the root directory, we'll run:

```bash
npm start
```

Then in a web browser navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and you should be greeted
with text in the body of the page that says "Hello from Rust, WebAssembly, and Webpack!"

If you did congrats! You've successfully used the rust-webpack template!
